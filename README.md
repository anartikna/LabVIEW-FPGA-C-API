# LabVIEW-FPGA-C-API
The FPGA Interface C API is a C API for communication between processor and FPGA within NI reconfigurable I/O (RIO) hardware such as NI CompactRIO,
NI Single-Board RIO, NI Ethernet RIO, NI FlexRIO, NI R Series multifunction RIO, and NI MXI-Express RIO for embedded control and acquisition applications.  
With the FPGA Interface C API, developers can use LabVIEW graphical tools to program the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) within NI hardware and 
choose either LabVIEW or C/C++ tools to program the processor within the system. This gives engineers and scientists with C expertise the ability 
to take advantage of FPGAs within their designs without the burden of learning hardware design while also giving them the option to reuse their 
existing embedded C code.
